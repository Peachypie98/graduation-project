## Introduction
My graduation project is a laser-based potato sprout remover machine.

#### How it works?
* Place a camera that shoot straight down a potato's sprout on top of the plate. 
* Creates an imaginary circle that surrounds on it. Once imaginary circle is created, use its radius value to determine the total distance we need to move the laser. 
* Once the laser on the rod is at the specified location, turn on the laser and rotate the plate to begin cutting the sprout.

## Algorithm
#### Imaginary Circle
